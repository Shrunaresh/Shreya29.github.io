In this project, I analyzed bike sales data to gain insights into the factors influencing customers' purchasing decisions. Using Excel, I created pivot tables to examine the correlations among various factors, including income, gender, education, marital status, and regions. These pivot tables helped me visualize and understand how these factors interrelate. The result is a comprehensive dashboard that presents the findings and highlights the key relationships between different variables.
