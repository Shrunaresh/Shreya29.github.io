Hi! my name is Shreya nresh. I am a Passionate SQL Learner who likes to Query with SQL a lot for Data analysis and love playing around the same. I have practiced SQL 
using some available datasets to create and showcase my own work. Thanks to TechTFQ on YouTube for his detailed explanation on various SQL concepts from Basic to 
Advanced Queries, which also helped me brush my SQL Skills that I had learnt in my Bachelor's degree in Information technology as a beginner and then learnt some 
advanced concepts throughout my work experiences and Learnings during my UnderGraduate degree. 
  The First File SQLQuery1 is completely a file that showcases my Basic Query knowledge to advanced Queries like JOIN, GROUP BY and some WINDOWS FUNCTIONS.
